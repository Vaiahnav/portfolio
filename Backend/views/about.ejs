                        Hi! I'm <strong>Vaishnav Paradkar</strong>, a dedicated software engineer with a strong passion
                        for solving real-world problems
                        through clean, efficient code and creating responsive, user-friendly web experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond coding, I enjoy diving into emerging technologies, experimenting with new projects,
                        and staying active by playing sports.
                    </p>
